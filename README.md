## Design 
### Hi-Fidelity Interface Rationale 
### User feedback & Iterations

## Reflection
### What went well
### What went wrong
Ideally the code should be obvious enough to everyone (including myself) and very rarely need to comment. I followed this philosophy in the beginninng, and once done. I commented through the code to explain it's functionality (as mentioned in the rubrics). However, looking back, I wish I commented why the code was written that way, instead of just what it is doing (and how).
